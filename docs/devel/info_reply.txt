ignitionServer --
Based on pureIRCd, written by Ben Affleck, Dennis Fisch,
Johnny aka Pern, and Eric Dickman. Aside from the network core
being the same, most of the code has been improved or tweaked.
The entire IRCX core is completely from scratch.

ignitionServer is actively developed by mainly one person, 
Keith Gable <ziggy@ignition-project.com>, but there have been
a few other contributors, namely Reid Burke <airwalk@airwalklogik.com>
and Nigel Jones <njonez@ihug.co.nz>. In fact, without Reid and
Nigel's help, ignitionServer would definitely not be as practical
as it is.

ignitionServer updates, releases, help, and information can be
received at our website, http://www.ignition-project.com/. If you

tracker: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=96071&atid=613526
