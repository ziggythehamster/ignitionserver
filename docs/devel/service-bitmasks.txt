ignitionServer SERVICE command bitmasks
=======================================

This document describes the value of the "type"
field of the SERVICE command. The type field is in
binary. To get a certain feature, add the numbers
together for the features you want.

The server must be configured to accept the service,
and the service must be explicitly allowed the type
of access it's requesting.

This is probably going to be 16 bits, broken up in
sections.

Setting the "type" to 0 gives services the same
privileges as normal users.

Note: Services will always be allowed to send
NOTICEs, since RFC1459 says all automated services
should only send NOTICEs. All services can also
join/create local channels, but those channels are
given a flag (and oper only unless it unsets that
mode)

Decimal | Constant         | Description
========| Section A: Access Level
1       | S_LOCOP      (1) | Gets the same access as a local operator
2       | S_GLOBOP     (2) | Gets the same access as a global operator
4       | S_NETADMIN   (3) | Gets the same access as a network administrator
8       | S_SERVER     (4) | Gets the same access as a server (and can introduce links/users **USE SPARANGLY**; shows up in LINKS as Nickname followed by a dot)
========| Section B: Special Privileges
16      | S_CANJOIN    (5) | Can join channels (can also create channels)
32      | S_HIDEINCHAN (6) | Hide the service in the channel (really meant for logging services and such)
64      | S_CANPRIVMSG (7) | Can send PRIVMSGs
128     | S_CANDATA    (8) | Can send DATA/REQUEST/REPLY
256     | S_CANKICK    (9) | Can kick users in channels (doesn't have to join to kick)
512     | S_CANUMODE   (A) | Can change the modes of a user
1024    | S_CANCMODE   (B) | Can change the modes of a channel
2048    | S_CANUPROP   (C) | Can change the properties of a user
4096    | S_CANCPROP   (D) | Can change the properties of a channel
8192    | S_CANIMPSRVR (E) | Can impersonate a server (send data claiming to come from a server - needs to be enabled if you're going to introduce links with S_SERVER)
16384   | S_CANIMPUSR  (F) | Can impersonate a user (send data claiming to come from a user - needs to be enabled if you're going to introduce users with S_SERVER)
32768   | S_HOOKEVENTS (G) | Can hook events

To get the features you want, add the decimal values
together for the features you want and place that
number in the configuration file. For example, a
typical services package will probably want to
either make each service connect individually, or
umbrella every service under a generic "Services"
user with S_SERVER, S_CANIMPUSR, and various other
modes.
