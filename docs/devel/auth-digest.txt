IRCX DIGEST AUTHENTICATION
==========================

0. INTRODUCTION

    This document describes Digest authentication, formatted specifically
    for the IRCX SASL authentication mechanism. Most of IRCX Digest
    authentication is based upon HTTP Digest authentication, RFC 2617.
    We have modified it to be friendly with IRCX and to allow users to
    authenticate on other "resources". More on this in a later section.

1. OVERVIEW OF IRCX AUTHENTICATION MECHANISM

    IRCX provides an authentication mechanism: the AUTH command. We will
    cover how this command/response is used, and how we are using it.

    There are two sequences -- an initial sequence (I) and a subsequent
    sequence (S). In IRCX, the AUTH command is formatted like this:

         AUTH <Method> <Sequence> :<Data>
    
    <Method> refers to the type of authentication that is going to be used.
    In our case, we are using Digest authentication.
    
    <Sequence> was explained earlier. The I sequence is used for the very
    first sequence (sent by the client), and the S sequence is used every
    time afterwards. If the sequence sent from the client is *, the server
    must abort authenticating the user. If the sequence sent from the server
    is *, the client has successfully authenticated. The * sequence received
    from the server is formatted slightly differently than the previous method:

         AUTH <Method> * <userid@domain> 0<OID>

    <userid@domain> refers to the user's "ident". The nickname is not known when
    authentication occurs, so only the user's username and hostname is returned.
    In IRCX Digest authentication, userid will refer to the username used to
    authenticate (the username token). If spaces are present, they should be
    escaped with \b. Consequently, all other escapable characters should be
    escaped with whatever is defined by the "Modified UTF-8 encoding of Unicode
    characters" in the IRCX draft. Domain could be the hostname from which the
    user is connecting from, or it could be the resource in which they're
    authenticating for (again, escaped).

    0<OID> is an object identifier, as defined by the IRCX draft. If the server
    does not support object identifiers, it should just have 0 in this field.

2. AUTHENTICATION PROCESS
    
    In order for HTTP Digest to be completely compatibie with IRCX, it had to
    have a few features removed, and a few added (such as resource). When a
    client wants to authenticate with Digest authentication, it will send the
    following line:

         AUTH Digest I :username="Username",resource="resource name"
    
    These are the only two parameters allowed in the initial sequence. As you
    can see from the example, the tokens are tokenname="Value" and seperated by
    commas. Usernames and resources may not contain commas, equal signs, at-signs,
    or quotes, so output isn't confused. If a line is unparsable, the server should 
    return the IRCERR_AUTHENTICATIONFAILED error message. The only required parameter
    for the I sequence is the username. Both usernames and resources may have any
    character allowed by IRCX, except for the characters previously mentioned. Escaping
    is required for every applicable character except for space (then it is optional).

    The server will now respond with a S sequence, if the username exists in the
    resource specified (if no resource is specified, assume the "default" resource):

         AUTH Digest S :nonce="332sdfqewrweq",opaque="asdf",resource="resource name"

    nonce is a random string (the longer the better) that will be used by the client
    to generate the hash. The server performs the same operation, and that's how
    authentication is done. This parameter is required.

    opaque is a random string that will not be altered by the client but will be
    returned in all subsequent replies. Think of it as a "checksum". It is not
    required, but its use is encouraged.

    resource is included here to specify what resource the server thinks you're
    authenticating for. If it was not specified in the initial sequence, the resource
    should be returned as "default" (or whatever the name of the default resource is).
    If resources are disabled or not being used, this parameter is optional.

    After the client receives this, it computes a hash. This hash is computed as
    follows:
    
         userhash = MD5(username + ":" + resource + ":" + password) 
         hash = MD5(userhash + ":" + nonce)

    This hash is then sent back to the server:

         AUTH Digest S :response="(hash)",opaque="asdf"
   
    The server does the same computation the client did, and if it gets the same
    hash, authentication must have succeeded. If the resource is not known (i.e.
    the server has disabled them), the userhash will look like this:

         userhash = MD5(username + ":" + ":" + password)

    opaque is only returned if it was specified by the server.

3. RESOURCES
    
    Resources are similar to realms in HTTP Digest. Like realms, they specify what
    exactly the user is authenticating for. However, realms can have any meaning,
    or could be used to prompt the user with any arbitrary string.

    Resources are more strict than realms. A user can belong in one resource but
    not an another. Because IRC doesn't have URIs, the administrator wouldn't be
    able to create seperate login areas. Resources take care of that.

    There are two standard resources: default and admin. Administrators may add
    more resources, as needed, but every server is expected to at least recognize
    these two resources (even if they don't accept them).

4. SAMPLE SUCCESSFUL AUTHENTICATION

    The username is "admin" and the password is "nimda". The process is listed from
    when the user connects to the server until the user successfully registers as a
    user. Additionally, the client does not specify a resource.

    (from client)    MODE ISIRCX
                     (the client is checking to see if the server supports IRCX)

    (from server)    :irc.somewhere.com 800 Anonymous 0 0 Digest,ANON 512 *
                     (the client sees the server supports IRCX and Digest authentication)

    (from client)    IRCX
                     (the client is enabling IRCX)
    
    (from server)    :irc.somewhere.com 800 Anonymous 1 0 Digest,ANON 512 *
                     (the server enables IRCX and returns the 800 reply)

    (from client)    AUTH Digest I :username="admin"
                     (tell the server to login as admin)
    
    (from server)    AUTH Digest S :nonce="e6def669a2b6d6f70c5b222c0f26eee8",opaque="89f3914a1b1b6b9d7fe29673f8658068",resource="default"
                     (the server responds with a nonce and an opaque token)
    
    Now, before the next S sequence is sent, the following computation occurs:
         
         userhash = MD5("admin:default:nimda")
         userhash = "89e6bfefca850042a530f047941441c3"
         hash = MD5("89e6bfefca850042a530f047941441c3:e6def669a2b6d6f70c5b222c0f26eee8") // the first hash is the 
                                                                                         // userhash, the second is the nonce,
                                                                                         // which doesn't necessarily have to be MD5
         hash = "daaed541c49b941f4c69a60a178b498d"

   Now that the hash is gathered, the client responds:

   (from client)    AUTH Digest S :response="daaed541c49b941f4c69a60a178b498d",opaque="89f3914a1b1b6b9d7fe29673f8658068"
                    (opaque was included because the server specified it)

   (from server)    AUTH Digest * admin@default 0
                    (the server responds with an "Authentication OK" message; the server is configured to show the resource in the
                    reply, although it could respond with a hostname. clients should NOT rely on this message to determine the client's
                    ident)
   
   (from client)    NICK Administrator
                    (the client specifies its nickname)

   (from client)    USER admin "somewhere.com" "irc.somewhere.com" :Administrator
                    (the client specifies its user information)

   (from server)    :irc.somewhere.com 001 Administrator :Welcome to the Somewhere IRC Network, Administrator!admin@myisp.com
                    (the standard 001 reply -- the format of it varies, so use whatever is appropriate for whatever IRCD is in use)
