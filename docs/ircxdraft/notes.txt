This directory contains all of the known IRCX drafts. Because none of them give versions, we can't 
accurately pick which one was supposed to be "the" IRCX standard. However, because it is newer, 
draft-pfenning-irc-extensions-04.txt is the draft we are using for reference. Older ones should be
ignored and are only here for backwards-reference (i.e. the newest one seems to have left out an
error message that is necessary -- "Some entries were not removed due to security", but it's in an 
older one).

If you are developing for IRCX, we HIGHLY suggest you use draft-pfenning-irc-extensions-04.txt for
reference. It seems that all IRCX implementations are using this particular draft, and it is also 
newer (the preface says you should use the newest one, as well).
