      This License applies to any manual or other work, in
      any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
      it can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
      grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use
      that work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
      refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
      licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
      copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under
      copyright law.
      </p><p><a id="gfdl-mod-ver"></a>
      A "Modified Version" of the Document means any
      work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim,
      or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
      </p><p><a id="gfdl-secnd-sect"></a>
      A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or
      a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
      relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
      Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing
      that could fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the
      Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may
      not explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
      historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
      legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
      regarding them.
      </p><p><a id="gfdl-inv-sect"></a>
      The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary
      Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant
      Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under
      this License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
      Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The
      Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not
      identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
      </p><p><a id="gfdl-cov-text"></a>
      The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of
      text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
      notice that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
      Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at
      most 25 words.
      </p><p><a id="gfdl-transparent"></a>
      A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
      machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is
      available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the
      document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
      composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
      available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
      formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable
      for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent
      file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to
      thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
      Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if used for any
      substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
      "Opaque".
      </p><p>
      Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
      ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
      XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
      PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
      transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
      include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
      processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
      HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
      purposes only.
      </p><p><a id="gfdl-title-page"></a>
      The "Title Page" means, for a printed book,
      the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold,
      legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
      For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
      Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's
      title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
      </p><p><a id="gfdl-entitled"></a>
      A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit
      of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
      parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language.
      (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
      "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To
      "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document
      means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this
      definition.
      </p><p>
      The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
      which states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
      Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
      but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
      these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
      meaning of this License.
