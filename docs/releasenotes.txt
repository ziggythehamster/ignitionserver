Comments:
This version of ignitionServer is mainly a bugfix release,
but we have also added IRCX auditorium and clone/cloneable.
In a nutshell, these modes are used as follows:
1) To make an auditorium, you must create the room with the
   CREATE command and specify the proper modes. Basically,
   /create #Channel xnt
2) To make a cloneable channel, you must be an IRC Operator,
   and you do it by going /mode #Channel +d.

Yes, all users can create auditoriums. The IRCX draft doesn't
specify whether or not it's operator-only. In an upcoming version,
we will have a new security infrastructure that says what levels
of users are required for what command/mode, and we will address
this issue there.

The /CREATE command does not properly function. This will be resolved
in the next version. Also, linking does not work at all. This will also
be resolved in the next version.
