# $Id: releasenotes.txt,v 1.17 2004/07/25 01:36:35 ziggythehamster Exp $


Changes:
Added MAXTARGETS=5 to the 005 reply
Removed STD=i-d from the 005 reply (I have no clue what it means)
Added some things to the 005 reply
Cleaned up /prop a bit
You cannot create channels with * or ?
Winsock errors previously reported as "Unknown" are now reported properly per the Platform SDK's definition.
ignitionServer now uses Winsock 2.0! Dumb mistake, but it should work fine now on newer systems.
Code cleanup!
Some Integers have been changed to Longs for speed (3-4KB of memory extra though)
ignitionServer no longer uses Val() as an array

New Features include:
DATA/REQUEST/REPLY is done! This means that Comic Chat functions properly now, and you can now proceed to use IRCX metadata :)
User properties! GUID, Identity, Nick, and OID
ignitionServer is now aware of the port clients connect on.
Mostly working /event system. It's almost the same as the MS Exchange event system.

Comments:
ignitionServer 0.3.3 is VERY MUCH improved from the previous version with
several new features, including the IRCX commands DATA, REQUEST, and REPLY.
These commands allow for non-text data to be transmitted to channels, users,
and other interested parties. These commands have traditionally been used
by Microsoft Chat to send comic character data, but any client is welcome
to add support for IRCX DATA/REQUEST/REPLY. There have also been several
annoying bugs fixed, and I have officially deemed linking to be "alpha".
No longer is it experimental :). Still, you shouldn't link to other servers
unless you're willing to file bug reports, but it won't blow up if you do
link servers.
