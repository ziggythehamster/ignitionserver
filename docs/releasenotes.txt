Comments:
ignitionServer 0.3.6 is mainly a bugfix release.
We have added very few new things, except for
logging. All users are strongly encouraged to
upgrade their ignitionServer installations to
ignitionServer 0.3.6. ignitionServer 0.3.7 will
hopefully contain a configuration wizard (with at
least "beginner" functionality; an advanced editor
is also intended but may not make it), some form
of IRCX authentication, and more RFC 1459 compliant
strings. We also hope to decrease the footprint
substantially.
