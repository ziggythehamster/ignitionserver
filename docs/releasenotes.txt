		RELEASE NOTES FOR IGNITIONSERVER RELEASE: 0.3.2
# $Id: releasenotes.txt,v 1.15 2004/07/02 23:16:56 ziggythehamster Exp $


Changes:
Changed the part/quit messages to be like FreeNode: *** Nick has quit ("Reason")
M: lines now have an extra parameter. This parameter tells the server which adapter to bind on. It goes directly before the port (:6667 => :*:6667). Use * for all adapters.
Real host names can be used in access entries if fake hostnames are enabled.
Optimizations
/version reply is more consistant with standards
Services are now reported as an IRC service in /whois
The "...is connecting from <addr>; IP address is <ip>" is now using raw 320 (RPL_WHOISSPECIAL)
NJOIN now returns "Permission Denied" for clients who aren't servers
ACCESS entries are now propragrated across the network
Deleting *!*@* from the access list is now the same as clearing the access list
Services can now set a channel's ACCOUNT property
SOCKET events are "normalized"
/CHGHOST can now be used by servers (and thusly hostname changes can be propragrated)

New Features include:
New IRC operator level system. You only need generic flags, like N (Network Admin), O (global operator), and o (local operator). Some things can optionally be added to the operator's privileges (for example: protected operator). See ircx.conf for an explaination.
/who * o now returns all IRC operators
PROP changes are now propragrated across the network
WallOps system is now working. Your operators need +W in order to send WallOps (/wallops message).
Command line control.exe -- lets you start/stop your server from the commandline (used in conjunction with the new monitor)
IRCXpro Migration Wizard -- lets you convert your existing IRCXpro settings to a format that ignitionServer can read
X:AUTOVHOST -- automatically give operators a VHost if a VHost exists with the same username and password
Knock/+u channel mode
Whisper (/whisper #Channel User Message)
More oper modes
New ignitionServer Monitor! It works on all versions of Windows and has a better UI too :)
New ignitionServer PassCrypt! No new features in it, but it's less buggy and a lot cooler looking
The monitor now has a "more info" button which shows some server statistics. Refreshed every 5 seconds.
