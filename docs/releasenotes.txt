Zg - [1-Feb] - X:SERVERLOCATION added
DG - [1-Feb] - X:CRYPT added
DG - [1-Feb] - /passcrypt added (P.S. Ziggy always leave an empty line at bottom...
Zg - [1-Feb] - fixed small bug Nigel had... PassCrypt replied as if the msg was coming from yourself. This could break some clients.
Zg - [2-Feb] - basis for event system is in.. MINIMAL ERROR TRAPPING! there are many things i need to do, so it's safe to say the event system does not yet exist!
Zg - [3-Feb] - USER events added
Zg - [3-Feb] - Fixed more EVENT errors -- no longer sends events twice
Zg - [3-Feb] - EVENT and CREATE now use RFC1459 origins (even though the IRCX draft doesn't specify). It's easier to code for if the command is in the same place as the rest of them.
Zg - [3-Feb] - KILL'd changed to Killed in m_kill.
Zg - [3-Feb] - Added framework for oper mode/flag +P (protected)
Zg - [3-Feb] - Oper mode +P (protected) is in full operation
Zg - [3-Feb] - Linked to X9Chat for a few minutes and found enough bugs to keep Sir William Gates busy for a few years. LINKING IS *EXPERIMENTAL*!
Zg - [4-Feb] - Fixed bug with channel key (+k)
Zg - [4-Feb] - Aliased /CONNECT to /LINK -- either now works (suggested by Michio)
Zg - [4-Feb] - Access-related modes are now sent to other servers (before, you'd be an owner/host/voice locally, but not on the other server).
DG - [5-Feb] - Test CVS Changes....
DG - [5-Feb] - Fix Bug Described in Bugs item #890182
Zg - [6-Feb] - Renamed ircd.log to ircx.log
Zg - [6-Feb] - Felt the urge to add /whois * for opers
Zg - [6-Feb] - Security bug is fixed now.
Zg - [6-Feb] - Fixed bug with /who; your status and if oper or not is shown in /who's not directed to a channel.
Zg - [6-Feb] - Access case-sensibility fixed.
DG - [7-Feb] - No more C/N Lines say Hi to just L Lines Ziggy please note i'll be re-using the C lines
Zg - [8-Feb] - Opers are no longer auto-q and no longer can defeat bans unless they are protected (+P).
Zg - [8-Feb] - Added more events (USER.PART/USER.JOIN)
Zg - [12-Feb] - Another bug identified... /part is broken! I'll be scanning my code since 7-Feb (before DG's addition) to see what got changed that fucks it up. Unless for some reason the server relies solely on C/N lines, it's my modified join code (restore to check?).
Zg - [13-Feb] - Combed the source and located the bug: It involved the previous misuse of a variable (note: pureIRCd used it wrong, and without double checking, I assumed they did it right). Fixed possible future bug where if you tried to /part a room that didn't exist it would generate an error.
Zg - [15-Feb] - Finished the core of the events system (DELETE, LIST added)
Zg - [15-Feb] - Tested events a bit; fixed a bug I found

DG - [19-Feb] - Added Umode/OperFlag E and Changed A -> N... (E Comes from Ultimate)
DG - [19-Feb] - Starting work on /add - ziggy leave this stuff alone I havn't finished with it and I know it so let me finish it off plus finish some other code I'm working on but Havn't Committed
