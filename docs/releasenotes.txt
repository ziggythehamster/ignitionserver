Changes:
*** WE HAVE REVERTED TO C: AND N: LINES! L: LINES WILL NO LONGER WORK!
All KILL messages coming from clients are now in quotes, so server kills can't be faked
RFC1459 is added to the 005 token list
All GUIDs are now Windows style GUIDs
If you make a stupid mistake with Y: and I: lines, it will notify you sometimes.

New Features include:
Channels now have GUIDs
B: (bounce) lines - read ircx.conf for a full description
LISTX flags! Now, you can search for channels with all kinds of options (limit, creation, topic, subject, language, etc.)
Servers now propragrate properties using our unofficial NPROP command
X:CREATEMODE - select who has permissions to create channels
X:STATICCHAN - create static channels (channels that always exist, are opless [unless an oper with sufficient privileges joins], and are limitless [unless an oper with sufficient privileges sets a limit])

Comments:
ignitionServer is a lot like a fine wine. With age, it keeps getting better and better. 0.3.5 is no different. In this version, we have 99% operational linking, several bug fixes, performance improvements, and a bunch of features of IRCX that we lacked, such as bounce lines, which allow you to forward certain users to a different server. The IRCX server message used is REDIRECT, and we use the 010 IRC reply for non-IRCX clients. We also now have LISTX flags, which allow you to search for a channel based on specific criteria. Basically, this version is 900% better than all previous versions. We've even plugged a few possible holes. At the rate we're going, 0.3.6 will be 900% better than this one. Bet you can't wait, eh?
