# $Id: releasenotes.txt,v 1.10 2004/06/06 23:54:04 ziggythehamster Exp $


Changes:
PING timeout message now suggests /RAW PONG :number or /QUOTE PONG :number
ircx.conf now has more help in it!
Optimized large portions of the code
Some nonstandard code is disabled (you have to rebuild iS to enable it).
/create generates a USER.JOIN event
/rehash now has fallback defaults, in case you really screw up configuring it
Added some missing commands to /stats m
Put /stats m in alphabetical order
Cleaned up IRCX stuff (MODE ISIRCX/ISIRCX/IRCX)

New Features include:
Full RFC 1459 client support
Better support for events
OnPart support
Persistant channels
Macros: <$COLON$> and <$NET$>
X:IRCXMETHOD - set how to send IRCX raws
X:REGCHANMODE - how registered channels are handled
Nearly all the properties are implemented now
Channel mode +R (persistant channel); can only be set by IRC operators while RegChanMode = 2
Microsoft Chat 2.5 now connects properly! (Comics don't work; they rely on DATA/REQUEST/REPLY)
mIRC's edit ban works properly
Added /INFO -- it has some information on ignitionServer

Comments:
Many, many bugs were fixed. We suggest everybody upgrades to 0.3.1 as soon
as possible. ignitionServer 0.3.1 also has many more features and RFC1459
clients are now properly supported (they weren't in previous versions). The
installer is also refined, and there are no longer any seperate 9x/NT builds.
New icons, too.

The updated monitor will hopefully be in 0.3.2, for those of you waiting for
it. Services is also coming soon.
