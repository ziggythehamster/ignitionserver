  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  </span>
</div>
<p align="center" class="style2"> 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
  under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below,<br>
  refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<br>
  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
  language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
  the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br>
  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
  along with the Program.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
  whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
  part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
  parties under the terms of this License.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
  when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
  interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
  announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
  notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
  a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
  these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
  License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
  does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
  the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
  
  <br>
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
  sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
  collective works based on the Program.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
  the scope of this License.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
  1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
  years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
  cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
  machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
  distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
  customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
  to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is<br>
  allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
  received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
  an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>
<p align="center" class="style2">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
  making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source<br>
  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
  control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a<br>
  special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
  itself accompanies the executable.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
  
  <br>
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
  except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt<br>
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
  parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
  distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are<br>
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br>
  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
  the Program or works based on it.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
  these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
  this License.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
  may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent<br>
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
  circumstances.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
  implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
  impose that choice.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
  
  <br>
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
  countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates<br>
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
  of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will<br>
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
  address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2">Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program<br>
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<br>
  later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
  Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
  Foundation.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
  to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
  make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> NO WARRANTY</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN<br>
  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE<br>
  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
