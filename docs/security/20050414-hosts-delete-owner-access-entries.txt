[ THE IGNITION PROJECT SECURITY BULLETIN ]----------------------------
This is a security bulletin from The Ignition Project, a group of open
source developers. It describes a flaw in one of our products, if
fixes are avaliable, how to fix the issue, and what exactly went
"wrong" that allows this security issue to occur.

(Product Information)_________________________________________________
Vendor:   The Ignition Project <http://www.ignition-project.com/>
Product:  ignitionServer
Versions: 0.3.0 to 0.3.6 (earlier versions may be affected)

(Vulnerability Information)___________________________________________
Vulnerability: Hosts can delete access entries added by owners
Reported By:   Keith Gable <ziggy@ignition-project.com>
Fix Available: Yes
How To Fix:    Upgrade to 0.3.6-P1
URL of Fix:    http://www.ignition-project.com/download
Criticality:   Low
Where:         Remote
Impact:        Privilege Escalation, Security Bypass

(Long Description)____________________________________________________
The IRCX draft specifically says that access entries added by owners
(users with a . before their name on chat) are only able to be deleted
by owners. We, however, have not implemented any checking to determine
if the user deleting the entry has sufficient privileges to do so.
This patch implements this feature.

This bug is not of extreme criticality because it does not affect the
server as a whole; it only affects channels. Also, hosts can already
see access entries added by owners.

(How To Exploit)______________________________________________________
[Owner]-> ACCESS #MyChan ADD VOICE *!*@* 0 :Voice everybody
[Host] -> ACCESS #MyChan DELETE VOICE *!*@*

(Vulnerable Code)_____________________________________________________
File Name: codemodules/mod_channel.bas
Function: m_access
Reason: Check if the creator of the entry was an owner, and if so,
        make sure the person deleting the entry is also an owner.

File Names: classmodules/clsBan.cls, classmodules/clsGrant.cls,
            classmodules/clsHost.cls, classmodules/clsOwner.cls,
            classmodules/clsVoice.cls
Reason: Need to add flag that stores the level of the person who
        originally created the entry
