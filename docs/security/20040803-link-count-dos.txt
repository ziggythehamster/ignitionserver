[ THE IGNITION PROJECT SECURITY BULLETIN ]----------------------------
This is a security bulletin from The Ignition Project, a group of open
source developers. It describes a flaw in one of our products, if
fixes are avaliable, how to fix the issue, and what exactly went
"wrong" that allows this security issue to occur.

(Product Information)_________________________________________________
Vendor:   The Ignition Project <http://www.ignition-project.com/>
Product:  ignitionServer
Versions: 0.1.2 to 0.3.1

(Vulnerability Information)___________________________________________
Vulnerability: Link Count Denial of Service
Reported By:   Keith Gable <ziggy@ignition-project.com> (Developer)
Fix Available: Yes
How To Fix:    Upgrade to 0.3.2 or newer
URL of Fix:    http://www.ignition-project.com/ignition/server/download/
Criticality:   Low
Where:         Remote
Impact:        DoS

(Long Description)____________________________________________________
Because the linking code in ignitionServer is still somewhat buggy,
an outsider can send a specially-crafted command to vulnerable systems
that can initiate a denial of service attack. Clients that have become
known to the system (through "registering" their connection) are
allowed to send the SERVER command, which is designed for server-to-
server communication only. This allows normal clients to "introduce"
servers to the network. This raises the number of servers listed in
/links, and everywhere else a link count is shown. The "introduced"
server is then propragrated across the network. Using some clever
trickery, a malicious user could flood the entire network by
"introducing" bad servers. However, linking is currently in an
experimental state, and therefore only testers actually use linking.
In a one server situation, the threat is small. An attacker could
increase the number of links to 2^32 (4 million), which could possibly
cause a buffer overrun if the exception catcher does not catch it.

(How To Exploit)______________________________________________________
Connect to a server, register your connection, and send a server
command as if you were registering as a server. The transaction looks
like this:

NICK Ziggy
USER Ziggy "ignition-project.com" "localhost" :Keith Gable
SERVER <random-string> 1 :Denial of Service

<random-string> is any string of characters, beginning with a letter,
and containing at least one period/dot (.). Examples of strings that
are legal are:

as.df
a5611436.
mysite.com

The server will not allow servers to identify themselves twice, so
there needs to be some randomness.

(Vulnerable Code)_____________________________________________________
To get the vulnerable code, checkout both sides of the release from
the SourceForge CVS repository. Instructions for this varies by
operating system, however, the basic information is as follows:

Server: cvs.sourceforge.net
Username: anonymous
Password: (none)
Repository Location: /cvsroot/ignition
Module name: ignitionserver

The tag names are RELEASE_0_2_3 and RELEASE_0_3_1. Use a "diff"
program for your particular operating system to see the code needed
to fix it.
