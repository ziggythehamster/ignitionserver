(How To Exploit)______________________________________________________
Connect to the server and begin to authenticate as a server, using
standard RFC 1459 methods (PASS/SERVER). If your system is vulnerable,
you will be able to connect reguardless of the password you send.

SourceForge CVS repository. Instructions for this varies by operating
system, however, the basic information is as follows:

Server: cvs.sourceforge.net
Username: anonymous
Password: (none)
Repository Location: /cvsroot/ignition
Module name: ignitionserver

The tag names are RELEASE_0_3_1 and RELEASE_0_3_1P1. Use a "diff"
