#-# Note about eXtended Configuration Lines (X: lines): X: lines were created so we could have a simpler  #-#
#-# way to define extra features without cramming them on one line or using all of the letters (or worse, #-#
#-# using a C-style configuration). The basic format of the X: line is:                                   #-#
#-# X:SECTION:PARAMETERS:PARAMETERS:... and so on. Most commands only have X:SECTION:PARAMETER and it's   #-#

#/die and /restart passwords
X:DIEPASS:die
X:RESTARTPASS:restart

#********************************** ATTENTION! IF YOU ARE GETTING "SERVER MISCONFIGURED", CHANGE THE 1 TO A 0!

#DIE - Comment Out, Delete or set to any non "1" number
#(this is to force you to configure your server!)
X:DIE:0

#OFFLINE MODE - Set to 1 to enable - 0 to disable.
X:OFFLINEMODE:0

#OFFLINE MESSAGE - Message to use when killing during Offline Mode
X:OFFLINEMESSAGE:This server is offline. Sorry.

#CNOTICE - Custom Auth Notice... Custom Message to send to connecting users.
X:CNOTICE:Welcome to your NEW ignitionServer installation. You should change this line to say something else.

#MASKDNS - Provides security for your users by masking their DNS
#Options
#0 - No Mask (default)
#1 - MD5 Sum Mask (of DNS)
#2 - HostName Mask (X:HOSTMASK) Must be set otherwise it will use "no mask" option
X:MASKDNS:2

#HIGHPROT & LOWPROT - Selects mode to be set on join for opers with P(High Prot) or p(Low Prot)
#Options
#Q - Auto Set +q on-oper-join
#O - Auto set +o on-oper-join
#V - Auto set +v on-oper-join
#NORM - No mode set on-oper-join
X:HIGHPROT:V
X:LOWPROT:V

#HOSTMASK - Used for MASKDNS(option 2). Users will get mask of <NickName>.<HOSTMASK> e.g. DigiGuy.Users.ignition-project.com
X:HOSTMASK:Users.ignition-project.com

#SERVERLOCATION - Lets you specify where the server is located (many times this is the same as the admin location.. however, this could be more generalized [like Oklahoma, US])
X:SERVERLOCATION:Unique Location, The World

#CRYPT - PassWord encryption (Set to "0" for None or "MD5" for MD5 encryption, use /passcrypt or ignitionServer PassCrypt to generate password...
X:CRYPT:MD5

#REMOTEPASS - Remote administration password -- coming soon :)
X:REMOTEPASS:098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6

#ALLOWMULTIPLE - Allow multiple instances of ignitionServer; ADVANCED FEATURE! Only set to 1 if you know what you're doing.
#notes: You should not set this to 1 unless you are wanting to run more than one copy of ignitionServer on the same machine. Additionally, the monitor
#       will not function as expected when this is on. Again, it is an ADVANCED FEATURE and is only designed for system administrators who know what they're doing.
#       (you could use this to bind different servers to different interfaces and essentially serve infinite servers on infinite IPs.. if you were a web host
#       for example)
X:ALLOWMULTIPLE:0

#GAGMODE
# 0 - Do not show the user getting gagged that they are getting gagged (IRCX defined method)
# 1 - Show the user getting gagged they are getting gagged
# 2 - Do not show the user getting gagged and do not bounce messages (the user will not see any messages bounce and will likely blame it on the server)
X:GAGMODE:0
