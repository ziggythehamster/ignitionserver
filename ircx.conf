#2 - HostName Mask(X:HOSTMASK) Must be set otherwise it will use DNS Option
X:MASKDNS:2

#HOSTMASK - Used for MASKDNS(option 2). Users will get mask of <NickName>.<HOSTMASK> e.g. DigiGuy.Users.ignition-project.com
X:HOSTMASK:Users.ignition-project.com

#SERVERLOCATION - Lets you specify where the server is located (many times this is the same as the admin location.. however, this could be more generalized [like Oklahoma, US])

#ALLOWMULTIPLE - Allow multiple instances of ignitionServer; ADVANCED FEATURE! Only set to 1 if you know what you're doing.
#notes: You should not set this to 1 unless you are wanting to run more than one copy of ignitionServer on the same machine. Additionally, the monitor
#       will not function as expected when this is on. Again, it is an ADVANCED FEATURE and is only designed for system administrators who know what they're doing.
#       (you could use this to bind different servers to different interfaces and essentially serve infinite servers on infinite IPs.. if you were a web host
#       for example)
X:ALLOWMULTIPLE:0
