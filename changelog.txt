### Project Start ###
#
Zg - [1-Dec] - added .Owner to some parts of the code
Zg - [1-Dec] - added IRCX command to some parts of the code (mod_main probably)
Zg - [3-Dec] - changed everything that says "pureIRCd" to say "ignitionServer" (to avoid future confusion)
Zg - [3-Dec] - fixed /ADMIN reply and format of A: line (original crew had it messed up)
Zg - [3-Dec] - added property variables
Zg - [3-Dec] - when checking for privs, check for owner as well
Zg - [3-Dec] - changed cloak/+x to deaf/+d (same purpose); +x in ircx is diff.
Zg - [3-Dec] - added m_prop, displays oid/topic
Zg - [4-Dec] - prop name is now set automatically, added check for key also check to see if the ownerkey or hostkey was specified (which are both valid)
Zg - [4-Dec] - removed /join 0 ability, somehow messed it up... (or wasn't working to begin with [for one it was originally /join #0])
Zg - [5-Dec] - for some weird reason, /prop is only accessible if you are an ircop ... doesn't appear to even execute the code under it... checking for bad values?! Duh.. looks like I wasn't setting Chan to the proper value before checking...
Zg - [6-Dec] - fixed some stuff in prop handling, added handling for these props: client, creation, name, oid, and illegally named properties (bad property)
Zg - [6-Dec] - added PROP and AUTH to /stats m
Zg - [7-Dec] - added IsHidden (+h) to modes
Zg - [7-Dec] - improved some property stuff, now depends on room visibility and member status (user, member, op, owner, voice, etc.)
Zg - [7-Dec] - added props: LANGUAGE, ONJOIN, ONPART, SUBJECT, TOPIC. + todo: make propsender decide who to send to (now sends to all, most props should only be sent to ops when changed (onjoin, onpart); also, onjoin and onpart aren't handled
Zg - [7-Dec] - added constant for mode +h
Zg - [7-Dec] - mode +h can be set and unset (does not take effect yet)
Zg - [7-Dec] - apparent bug in the setting/unsetting of +p/+s/+h: the modes don't get sent as removed to the client; circumvented by making it always kill the bad modes
Zg - [7-Dec] -  outside props don't work; you musy be in channel for it to work atm
DG - [10-Dec] - Changed the ChangeLog so it's easier to understand :P

DG - [12-Dec] - Moved Documentation to a New Dir(Docs) + Added Readme.rtf and license.rtf
Zg - [12-Dec] - Fixed #858578 part 1: Deopping Owners
Zg - [12-Dec] - Fixed several errors from the original pure-IRCd (need more params doesn't return the right command occasionally -- hard coded problem)

Zg - [12-Dec] - {BUG #858578} Fixed!
Zg - [13-Dec] - Removed HalfOp until we can decide on a mode for it
Zg - [13-Dec] - Added /LISTX
Zg - [13-Dec] - /LISTX being a little bitchy
Zg - [13-Dec] - /LISTX is implemented, minimally for now.
Zg - [13-Dec] - /IRCDHELP renamed to /IRCXHELP (/ircdhelp and /raw help will work, however)

Zg - [13-Dec] - HostKey and OwnerKey make you the appropriate status in the channel
Zg - [13-Dec] - You should no longer be able to ban IRCops
Zg - [13-Dec] - Miscallenous other things (check diffs for official definition)
Zg - [14-Dec] - Found bug #860115

Zg - [15-Dec] - Fixed VHost thing that DG found in his copy (pre-existing condition)
Zg - [15-Dec] - Added "is connecting from" to whois - someone's real hostname; had to add WhoisAccessLevel in order to facilitate this
Zg - [19-Dec] - Added a crapload of stuff tonight, including (but not limited to) the beginning of the access list, creation prop, /whois and /stats enhancements, and a few bugfixes
Zg - [19-Dec] - OnJoin now shows up
Zg - [19-Dec] - More access related stuff (Reason)
Zg - [20-Dec] - All ACCESS #Channel ADD and ACCESS #Channel CLEAR commands work, however I need to check to see if an access entry already exists (you can add SilentSoft-Ziggy to access an infinite number of times)
Zg - [21-Dec] - You can't ban someone with +b more than one time anymore (well, you could if you kept doing different things with their hostmask)
Zg - [21-Dec] - Added Access Delete
Zg - [22-Dec] - Access Delete checks for proper privledges first, and if the entry doesn't exist, it doesn't add it
Zg - [22-Dec] - Access has been added! Now to fix the bugs which make it not work... (doing a commit just in case i screw stuff up)
Zg - [22-Dec] - It was bound to happen: I made a stupid mistake... when I copied and pasted the classes I forgot to change the clsVoice to the proper class in a few places
Zg - [22-Dec] - In an attempt to stop errors, AddX has become a method (I never really used it the way it was)
Zg - [22-Dec] - I am an idiot! :D The whole problem this whole entire time was about 4 lines I didn't put in Class_Initialize and Class_Terminate. I've been screwing with this for the past 3 days! GRR!!!!! Someone hit me in the head with a 2x4 (actually, since I'm a hamster, it might hurt a lot)
Zg - [22-Dec] - Added checks for duplicate access entries when ADDing
Zg - [22-Dec] - People are q/o/v based on their access entries
Zg - [22-Dec] - You can defeat a ban if you are granted, or host/owner, or if you specify a working key (host/member/owner)
Zg - [22-Dec] - Serious issues with determining if an entry exists or not (very annoying)
Zg - [22-Dec] - Fixed the annoying issues with access add/delete
Zg - [22-Dec] - YAY!!!!!!!! I FINALLY FIXED ACCESS! WHEE! Look at me! Ahem.. anyways.. I probably added about ~150 lines or so of unnecessary code (oops).. And duration isn't yet coded (meaning all entries are permanent until I code it in)
Zg - [22-Dec] - The server now sets IsIRCX whenever you turn IRCX on (and sends usermode +x)
Zg - [22-Dec] - GetModes returns +h now (whoops - slight mishap there)
Zg - [23-Dec] - /list and /listx now hide rooms that are +h
Zg - [10-Jan] - revised ircx.conf (preparing for release of 0.1.2)

DG - [1-Feb] - /passcrypt added (P.S. Ziggy always leave an empty line at bottom...
Zg - [1-Feb] - fixed small bug Nigel had... PassCrypt replied as if the msg was coming from yourself. This could break some clients.
Zg - [2-Feb] - basis for event system is in.. MINIMAL ERROR TRAPPING! there are many things i need to do, so it's safe to say the event system does not yet exist!
Zg - [3-Feb] - USER events added
Zg - [3-Feb] - Fixed more EVENT errors -- no longer sends events twice
Zg - [3-Feb] - EVENT and CREATE now use RFC1459 origins (even though the IRCX draft doesn't specify). It's easier to code for if the command is in the same place as the rest of them.
Zg - [3-Feb] - KILL'd changed to Killed in m_kill.
Zg - [3-Feb] - Added framework for oper mode/flag +P (protected)
Zg - [3-Feb] - Oper mode +P (protected) is in full operation

Zg - [4-Feb] - Aliased /CONNECT to /LINK -- either now works (suggested by Michio)
Zg - [4-Feb] - Access-related modes are now sent to other servers (before, you'd be an owner/host/voice locally, but not on the other server).
DG - [5-Feb] - Test CVS Changes....
DG - [5-Feb] - Fix Bug Described in Bugs item #890182
Zg - [6-Feb] - Renamed ircd.log to ircx.log
Zg - [6-Feb] - Felt the urge to add /whois * for opers
Zg - [6-Feb] - Security bug is fixed now.
Zg - [6-Feb] - Fixed bug with /who; your status and if oper or not is shown in /who's not directed to a channel.

DG - [7-Feb] - No more C/N Lines say Hi to just L Lines Ziggy please note i'll be re-using the C lines
Zg - [8-Feb] - Opers are no longer auto-q and no longer can defeat bans unless they are protected (+P).
Zg - [8-Feb] - Added more events (USER.PART/USER.JOIN)
Zg - [12-Feb] - Another bug identified... /part is broken! I'll be scanning my code since 7-Feb (before DG's addition) to see what got changed that fucks it up. Unless for some reason the server relies solely on C/N lines, it's my modified join code (restore to check?).
Zg - [13-Feb] - Combed the source and located the bug: It involved the previous misuse of a variable (note: pureIRCd used it wrong, and without double checking, I assumed they did it right). Fixed possible future bug where if you tried to /part a room that didn't exist it would generate an error.
Zg - [15-Feb] - Finished the core of the events system (DELETE, LIST added)
Zg - [15-Feb] - Tested events a bit; fixed a bug I found
