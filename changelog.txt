### Project Start ###
#
Zg - [1-Dec] - added .Owner to some parts of the code
Zg - [1-Dec] - added IRCX command to some parts of the code (mod_main probably)
Zg - [3-Dec] - changed everything that says "pureIRCd" to say "ignitionServer" (to avoid future confusion)
Zg - [3-Dec] - fixed /ADMIN reply and format of A: line (original crew had it messed up)
Zg - [3-Dec] - added property variables
Zg - [3-Dec] - when checking for privs, check for owner as well
Zg - [3-Dec] - changed cloak/+x to deaf/+d (same purpose); +x in ircx is diff.
Zg - [3-Dec] - added m_prop, displays oid/topic
Zg - [4-Dec] - prop name is now set automatically, added check for key also check to see if the ownerkey or hostkey was specified (which are both valid)
Zg - [4-Dec] - removed /join 0 ability, somehow messed it up... (or wasn't working to begin with [for one it was originally /join #0])
Zg - [5-Dec] - for some weird reason, /prop is only accessible if you are an ircop ... doesn't appear to even execute the code under it... checking for bad values?! Duh.. looks like I wasn't setting Chan to the proper value before checking...
Zg - [6-Dec] - fixed some stuff in prop handling, added handling for these props: client, creation, name, oid, and illegally named properties (bad property)
Zg - [6-Dec] - added PROP and AUTH to /stats m
Zg - [7-Dec] - added IsHidden (+h) to modes
Zg - [7-Dec] - improved some property stuff, now depends on room visibility and member status (user, member, op, owner, voice, etc.)
Zg - [7-Dec] - added props: LANGUAGE, ONJOIN, ONPART, SUBJECT, TOPIC. + todo: make propsender decide who to send to (now sends to all, most props should only be sent to ops when changed (onjoin, onpart); also, onjoin and onpart aren't handled
Zg - [7-Dec] - added constant for mode +h
Zg - [7-Dec] - mode +h can be set and unset (does not take effect yet)
Zg - [7-Dec] - apparent bug in the setting/unsetting of +p/+s/+h: the modes don't get sent as removed to the client; circumvented by making it always kill the bad modes
Zg - [7-Dec] -  outside props don't work; you musy be in channel for it to work atm
DG - [10-Dec] - Changed the ChangeLog so it's easier to understand :P
DG - [10-Dec] - Added all new Help System - Should be good.
DG - [10-Dec] - Added copyright notice as well

DG - [11-Dec] - Added Oper Help - More just for a Test Commit
DG - [11-Dec] - Renamed ircd.conf to ircx.conf
DG - [11-Dec] - Renamed hard coding of motd file name from ircd.motd to ircx.motd

DG - [12-Dec] - Moved Documentation to a New Dir(Docs) + Added Readme.rtf and license.rtf
Zg - [12-Dec] - Fixed #858578 part 1: Deopping Owners
Zg - [12-Dec] - Fixed several errors from the original pure-IRCd (need more params doesn't return the right command occasionally -- hard coded problem)

Zg - [12-Dec] - {BUG #858578} Fixed!
Zg - [13-Dec] - Removed HalfOp until we can decide on a mode for it
Zg - [13-Dec] - Added /LISTX
Zg - [13-Dec] - /LISTX being a little bitchy
Zg - [13-Dec] - /LISTX is implemented, minimally for now.
Zg - [13-Dec] - /IRCDHELP renamed to /IRCXHELP (/ircdhelp and /raw help will work, however)
Zg - [13-Dec] - Added two functions: SendToChanOwners, SendToChanOps. Same format as SendToChan. SendToChanOps sends to owners and hosts
Zg - [13-Dec] - Added OwnerKey
Zg - [13-Dec] - Added HostKey
Zg - [13-Dec] - HostKey and OwnerKey make you the appropriate status in the channel
Zg - [13-Dec] - You should no longer be able to ban IRCops
Zg - [13-Dec] - Miscallenous other things (check diffs for official definition)
Zg - [14-Dec] - Found bug #860115

Zg - [15-Dec] - Cleaned the ircx.conf up a little bit
Zg - [15-Dec] - IRC Operators are now made Owner in all channels they join
Zg - [15-Dec] - Added MODE ISIRCX, ISIRCX, variable for capabilities (future extension)
Zg - [15-Dec] - Fixed VHost thing that DG found in his copy (pre-existing condition)
Zg - [15-Dec] - Added "is connecting from" to whois - someone's real hostname; had to add WhoisAccessLevel in order to facilitate this
Zg - [19-Dec] - Added a crapload of stuff tonight, including (but not limited to) the beginning of the access list, creation prop, /whois and /stats enhancements, and a few bugfixes
Zg - [19-Dec] - OnJoin now shows up
Zg - [19-Dec] - More access related stuff (Reason)
Zg - [20-Dec] - All ACCESS #Channel ADD and ACCESS #Channel CLEAR commands work, however I need to check to see if an access entry already exists (you can add SilentSoft-Ziggy to access an infinite number of times)
Zg - [21-Dec] - You can't ban someone with +b more than one time anymore (well, you could if you kept doing different things with their hostmask)
Zg - [21-Dec] - Added Access Delete
Zg - [22-Dec] - Access Delete checks for proper privledges first, and if the entry doesn't exist, it doesn't add it
Zg - [22-Dec] - Access has been added! Now to fix the bugs which make it not work... (doing a commit just in case i screw stuff up)
Zg - [22-Dec] - It was bound to happen: I made a stupid mistake... when I copied and pasted the classes I forgot to change the clsVoice to the proper class in a few places
Zg - [22-Dec] - In an attempt to stop errors, AddX has become a method (I never really used it the way it was)
Zg - [22-Dec] - I am an idiot! :D The whole problem this whole entire time was about 4 lines I didn't put in Class_Initialize and Class_Terminate. I've been screwing with this for the past 3 days! GRR!!!!! Someone hit me in the head with a 2x4 (actually, since I'm a hamster, it might hurt a lot)
Zg - [22-Dec] - Added checks for duplicate access entries when ADDing
Zg - [22-Dec] - People are q/o/v based on their access entries
Zg - [22-Dec] - You can defeat a ban if you are granted, or host/owner, or if you specify a working key (host/member/owner)
Zg - [22-Dec] - Serious issues with determining if an entry exists or not (very annoying)
Zg - [22-Dec] - Fixed the annoying issues with access add/delete
Zg - [22-Dec] - YAY!!!!!!!! I FINALLY FIXED ACCESS! WHEE! Look at me! Ahem.. anyways.. I probably added about ~150 lines or so of unnecessary code (oops).. And duration isn't yet coded (meaning all entries are permanent until I code it in)
Zg - [22-Dec] - The server now sets IsIRCX whenever you turn IRCX on (and sends usermode +x)
Zg - [22-Dec] - GetModes returns +h now (whoops - slight mishap there)
Zg - [23-Dec] - /list and /listx now hide rooms that are +h
Zg - [10-Jan] - revised ircx.conf (preparing for release of 0.1.2)

Zg - [1-Feb] - X:DNSMASK added
Zg - [1-Feb] - X:SERVERLOCATION added
DG - [1-Feb] - X:CRYPT added
DG - [1-Feb] - /passcrypt added (P.S. Ziggy always leave an empty line at bottom...
Zg - [1-Feb] - fixed small bug Nigel had... PassCrypt replied as if the msg was coming from yourself. This could break some clients.
Zg - [2-Feb] - basis for event system is in.. MINIMAL ERROR TRAPPING! there are many things i need to do, so it's safe to say the event system does not yet exist!
Zg - [3-Feb] - USER events added
Zg - [3-Feb] - Fixed more EVENT errors -- no longer sends events twice
Zg - [3-Feb] - EVENT and CREATE now use RFC1459 origins (even though the IRCX draft doesn't specify). It's easier to code for if the command is in the same place as the rest of them.
Zg - [3-Feb] - KILL'd changed to Killed in m_kill.
Zg - [3-Feb] - Added framework for oper mode/flag +P (protected)
Zg - [3-Feb] - Oper mode +P (protected) is in full operation
Zg - [3-Feb] - Linked to X9Chat for a few minutes and found enough bugs to keep Sir William Gates busy for a few years. LINKING IS *EXPERIMENTAL*!
Zg - [4-Feb] - Fixed bug with channel key (+k)
Zg - [4-Feb] - Aliased /CONNECT to /LINK -- either now works (suggested by Michio)
Zg - [4-Feb] - Access-related modes are now sent to other servers (before, you'd be an owner/host/voice locally, but not on the other server).
DG - [5-Feb] - Test CVS Changes....
DG - [5-Feb] - Fix Bug Described in Bugs item #890182
Zg - [6-Feb] - Renamed ircd.log to ircx.log

Zg - [6-Feb] - Fixed bug with /who; your status and if oper or not is shown in /who's not directed to a channel.
Zg - [6-Feb] - Access case-sensibility fixed.
DG - [7-Feb] - No more C/N Lines say Hi to just L Lines Ziggy please note i'll be re-using the C lines
Zg - [8-Feb] - Opers are no longer auto-q and no longer can defeat bans unless they are protected (+P).
Zg - [8-Feb] - Added more events (USER.PART/USER.JOIN)
Zg - [12-Feb] - Another bug identified... /part is broken! I'll be scanning my code since 7-Feb (before DG's addition) to see what got changed that fucks it up. Unless for some reason the server relies solely on C/N lines, it's my modified join code (restore to check?).
Zg - [13-Feb] - Combed the source and located the bug: It involved the previous misuse of a variable (note: pureIRCd used it wrong, and without double checking, I assumed they did it right). Fixed possible future bug where if you tried to /part a room that didn't exist it would generate an error.
Zg - [15-Feb] - Finished the core of the events system (DELETE, LIST added)
Zg - [15-Feb] - Tested events a bit; fixed a bug I found

DG - [19-Feb] - Added Umode/OperFlag E and Changed A -> N... (E Comes from Ultimate)
DG - [19-Feb] - Starting work on /add - ziggy leave this stuff alone I havn't finished with it and I know it so let me finish it off plus finish some other code I'm working on but Havn't Committed
DG - [19-Feb] - Changed Default MOTD
DG - [20-Feb] - /add finished but /del and /mod is still on it's way
DG - [20-Feb] - Fixed up Copyright Notices
DG - [20-Feb] - Changed Docs tiny bit
DG - [20-Feb] - Can't Remember what else...
DG - [20-Feb] - Added MaskDNS Option 2(Auto Host Name) - Note Ziggy the VHost won't change after /nick this is not a bug it's a feature
DG - [20-Feb] - I think I found a links bug... Damit
DG - [20-Feb] - Fixed Bug 901367(Stats O)
DG - [20-Feb] - Started work on /remoteadm
DG - [20-Feb] - Added +Z
DG - [21-Feb] - Added /remoteadm Login
DG - [21-Feb] - Added /remoteadm SEND [Oper/Server]
DG - [21-Feb] - As Ziggy is prep'ing to move He's not coding so It won't matter if I hold back all the actual changes(cos they are incomplete)

#
### RELEASE - 0.2.2 - BETA RC2 ###
#
DG - [13-Mar] - Copyright Update.
DG - [13-Mar] - Changed ReadMes a tiny bit.
DG - [13-Mar] - Version Update.
Zg - [13-Mar] - Began work on pings
Zg - [13-Mar] - Ping? Pong! Hell yes!
Zg - [13-Mar] - PING is sent DIRECTLY out the socket -- SendQ's and RecvQ's have absolutely no effect on the sending of pings (i.e. pings are of the highest priority)
Zg - [14-Mar] - PING/PONG works right now.. sort of... users who ponged are getting disconnected for some reason. Committing first, just in case I need to go back for some reason.
Zg - [14-Mar] - m_error is not properly clearing the socket crap -- the /raw close bug still exists :'(
Zg - [14-Mar] - PING/PONG appears to be completely operational! Woo hoo :D
Zg - [14-Mar] - Added N to list of modes in the signon
AW - [14-Mar] - Fixed custom auth notice not showing up when you get "Nickname in use"
Zg - [14-Mar] - Fixed possible bug with pings/pongs
Zg - [14-Mar] - Added filter for bad idents
Zg - [14-Mar] - Clarified the X:DIE: message -- it now says to see ircx.conf
Zg - [15-Mar] - Fixed /kline bug
Zg - [15-Mar] - If a remote server sets a mode on a user that is local to the current server, the local user sees the mode get set
Zg - [15-Mar] - For some reason, I can't add +S to clsClient (Public IsService As Boolean)
Zg - [16-Mar] - Raw 307 added - "is a registered nick"
Zg - [16-Mar] - Fixed bug that added an extra : before the nick during a nick change that got sent to another server (::Ziggy NICK ZiggyTest was the behavior experienced)
Zg - [17-Mar] - Made +N do something -- if you are a netadmin, your /whois will say so. However, you still are equal to every other oper.
Zg - [17-Mar] - Filtered +S from m_umode to prevent IRC operators maliciously making themselves a service when I add that mode
Zg - [17-Mar] - I think I'm going to add +z/gag later today... stay tuned :P
Zg - [19-Mar] - Added gag/+z
Zg - [19-Mar] - Added GagModes, since not everyone wants to follow the IRCX draft when talking about gags.. 0=IRCX 1=Nice 2=IRCX-Notice
Zg - [19-Mar] - Opers can now view modes of other users -- slightly pointless, but possibly useful if you're looking for an oper that can restart because you've messed something up...
Zg - [19-Mar] - Added a few modes that were missing from GetModes
Zg - [19-Mar] - Corrected small misunderstanding in GetWhois -- if you are +N, you get your own reply for it (according to Jeepster's numeric.hlp).. 308
Zg - [20-Mar] - Fixed issue with making yourself +P as an oper
Zg - [20-Mar] - Fixed typo in ircx.conf
Zg - [21-Mar] - Attempted fixing the "Max connections reached for this IP" error (seems to be fixed)
Zg - [21-Mar] - Added /mdie -- a command for the monitor. Includes several security functions so it can't be used maliciously. First, it makes sure that the number specified matches the number in monitor.id and that the user is connecting from localhost.
Zg - [21-Mar] - If you are connecting from localhost/127.0.0.1 and X:DIE:1 is set, the server will rehash when you connect. This functionality exists so you don't have to control-alt-delete to restart the server.
Zg - [23-Mar] - Added code to process access entries for a channel (needed on /access, /mode, and /join)
Zg - [23-Mar] - Processing of Access Entries code has been set aside for the time being. I'll work on it some more tomorrow when I've had some sleep.
Zg - [24-Mar] - Began debugging the CycleAccess code; it works somewhat
Zg - [24-Mar] - Added code to help prevent /access problems
Zg - [24-Mar] - Access durations are now working! However, I failed to plan for this properly when I thought up the idea, and now the duration doesn't decrease every 60 seconds :$ This is a "feature", if you will, and can wait
Zg - [24-Mar] - Repaired slight problem with debugging strings in mod_channel
Zg - [24-Mar] - Fixed bug with attempting to add access outside a channel
Zg - [24-Mar] - Fixed bug with access list editing and the thing that removes entries after a specified period of time (the access duration code)
DG - [27-Mar] - Someone at LH deleted our account... dam them so we lost SVN
DG - [28-Mar] - SVN Back up, SVN Rev count reset to 0 and also bug tracker back to Bug 0 (Not reinstalled yet)
DG - [30-Mar] - Messed with the GPL stuff a tiny bit (Just out of fun...)
Zg - [30-Mar] - Added line to prevent possible exploitation of /mdie if they had read access to monitor.id and could somehow connect via localhost.
Zg - [30-Mar] - Worked on preliminary release notes
DG - [30-Mar] - Some tidyups of Ziggy's Coding, More to come.
DG - [30-Mar] - Added +p (Lower Protect)
DG - [30-Mar] - Added X:HIGHPROT & X:LOWPROT to define the mode given on join.
DG - [30-Mar] - Added some stuff in README
DG - [30-Mar] - Ziggy messed up ReleaseNotes for 0.2.3 (IDIOT) - Ziggy: next time leave them for me to do...
DG - [30-Mar] - Opps STUPID MISTAKE... forgot to put 'p' in 005 reply
DG - [30-Mar] - Readme Updates
DG - [31-Mar] - Release Notes in
DG - [31-Mar] - Updated Version
DG - [31-Mar] - Tagging...
#
### RELEASE - 0.2.3 - BETA RC3 ###
#
DG - [31-Mar] - Post Release stuff.
Zg - [1-Apr] - Added some documentation to the ircx.conf file (just realized that we don't have help anywhere for it other than what we had in the parameter definitions)
Zg - [1-Apr] - When creating a room in a non-IRCX client, you show as a +o (per the IRCX draft)
Zg - [2-Apr] - Non-IRCX clients now get /names in RFC1459 format (per IRCX draft)
Zg - [2-Apr] - Non-IRCX clients now get /who #Channel in RFC1459 format (per IRCX draft)
Zg - [2-Apr] - Fixed possible bug with /who reply -- no longer sending erroneous @/+'s (.@ if +qo/+qov, for example)
Zg - [2-Apr] - /whois fixed for non-IRCX clients (IRCX draft, again :))
Zg - [2-Apr] - Attempted fixing the issue with /who'ing (should work now)
Zg - [2-Apr] - Did we ever add OnPart? I think it was pending a rewrite of the /part code...
Zg - [2-Apr] - OnPart is now operational!
Zg - [2-Apr] - Fixed bug with parting multiple channels
Zg - [2-Apr] - Made OnJoin more conformant with IRCX (It was :#Chan PRIVMSG #Chan, and it shouldn't have been)
Zg - [2-Apr] - Idea for regged channels: in m_part, check if IsRegistered, if true, don't remove the channel if members = 0 (to be implemented later today or tomorrow probably)
DG - [3-Apr] - Cleaned up mod_list.bas
DG - [4-Apr] - Just testing some stuff.
DG - [4-Apr] - Ok my test fucked up as I was in Linux at the time and Linux have different line break styles when I went back into windows to upload the mod_list.bas update the changelog was all messed up.
DG - [4-Apr] - Prop'ed svn:eol-style This should solve the problem
DG - [4-Apr] - ChangeLog Update
Zg - [6-Apr] - Did some optimizing of mod_channel (mainly access-related)
Zg - [6-Apr] - Added EVENT CHANNEL framework
Zg - [6-Apr] - Optimized EVENT code significantly
Zg - [7-Apr] - Commented-out default P: lines -- people without the 192.168.0.1 adapter can't use the server, and it also makes the configuration harder for normal lusers. Also, if 6668 is in use, it causes more problems. Simply put, it's easier this way. If they want more ports, they can add more ports :)
Zg - [9-Apr] - do_nick_name now checks for any capitalization of Anonymous.
Zg - [9-Apr] - Illegal nicknames can no longer be set with /chgnick
Zg - [9-Apr] - Whoops. Didn't save changelog before committing...
Zg - [9-Apr] - CHANNEL.CREATE added.
Zg - [9-Apr] - /create now generates a USER.JOIN event
Zg - [9-Apr] - If /create is used by a non-IRCX client, it will show them as a host/op.
Zg - [9-Apr] - Fixed redundancy with m_topic -- parv(1) was already getting truncated and then we go and attempt to truncate it again...
Zg - [9-Apr] - Fixed bug with TOPIC and PROP TOPIC not correlating
Zg - [9-Apr] - TopicLen is now enforced when a user uses PROP TOPIC
Zg - [9-Apr] - PROP MEMBERKEY isn't going to be like IRCX defines -- it's settable by any host/owner and readable by all members (like +k is)
Zg - [9-Apr] - Added functionality for PROP MEMBERKEY
Zg - [9-Apr] - Optimized some of m_prop
Zg - [9-Apr] - MODE +k and PROP MEMBERKEY now properly correlate
Zg - [9-Apr] - IRCX clients get the IRCX-specific method (PROP TOPIC for example); 1459 clients get the 1459 method. Note: MODE +k gets sent to IRCX clients both ways because of how the MODE code is (probably should remove the IRCX sending bit, but then IRCX clients that are solely IRCX won't get the password)
Zg - [9-Apr] - In light of the outrageous number of bad programmers out there, I added a new switch: X:IRCXMETHOD:0|1. Method of sending IRCX-related stuff. 0 = both get 1459 1 = split up.. 1459 clients get 1459; IRCX gets IRCX. 2 = send both
Zg - [10-Apr] - Added CHANNEL.JOIN event
Zg - [10-Apr] - Added new macro system. This allows for generic text and stuff to be simplified. Only a few fields, like the ones that allow freeform text, are parsed.
Zg - [10-Apr] - Added <$COLON$> macro. Allows you to put a : somewhere in your text. 
Zg - [10-Apr] - Added <$NET$> macro. Allows you to insert your IRC network name somewhere.

Zg - [10-Apr] - Added IRCX drafts to Docs/

Zg - [29-May] - Fixed bug #962843
Zg - [29-May] - Added /gline, /fnick, and /fhost as aliases to /chgnick and /chghost (/gline may or may not be removed -- depends on whether or not I add a G: line) (satisfies task #94222)
Zg - [29-May] - Added more help to ircx.conf. Surely this will eliminate stupid config questions asked by stupid people ^^,
Zg - [29-May] - Fixed bug #908810 (MSChat 2.5 OnJoin crash)
Zg - [29-May] - Attempted fixing the uptime counter thing. Maybe it'll work properly with huge uptimes.

Zg - [30-May] - Fixed bug #962870 (sloppy code in IRCXMode)
Zg - [30-May] - Added code to Rehash that resets everything to null or otherwise default. This way, if you remove a line or comment it out, it will recognize it and act accordingly. The code is rather large and simplistic, but still probably could be simplified...
Zg - [30-May] - Completed task #99625 (persistant channels)
Zg - [30-May] - Added X:REGCHANMODE that picks how registered channels behave. 0 = all +r chans are always open, 1 = no +r chans are always open, 2 = only +R chans are always open
Zg - [30-May] - Also added +R chan mode, which can only be set by local and global operators

Zg - [2-Jun] - Added + to a couple other circumstances that Reid forgot.
Zg - [2-Jun] - Fixed some bugs, commented some code, added some bug info to the nick code (in case an error occurs, we have a more accurate pointer for where the error is happening)
Zg - [2-Jun] - Changed the PING timeout thing to say /RAW PONG :number or /QUOTE PONG :number -- some clients don't support one or the other.

Zg - [2-Jun] - Added +R to GetModes

Zg - [2-Jun] - Optimized a bunch of code. Probably not noticable unless the load is heavy.
Zg - [2-Jun] - Organized the code a little. Added a few modules (nonstandard, extracommands) to facilitate this. This could also let us do some customizable builds.
Zg - [3-Jun] - Fixed bug #965341 (access time doesn't look like it's counting down)
Zg - [3-Jun] - Corrected a change that makes the previous commit fail to compile
Zg - [3-Jun] - Fixed bug #962956 (mode +b doesn't work)
Zg - [3-Jun] - Added code that makes mIRC's weird rename ban work
Zg - [4-Jun] - Completed task #99516 (shorthand access add)
Zg - [4-Jun] - Fixed bug where an access list would come back with a negative number (i.e. if the entry was infinite [0])
Zg - [5-Jun] - Fixed bug #966253 (before-registration replies)
Zg - [5-Jun] - Completed task #99911 (error log)
Zg - [5-Jun] - Fixed bug #966249 (telnet doesn't work)

Zg - [7-Jun] - Fixed bug #967769 (MaxClones fails to function sometimes)
Zg - [8-Jun] - Much tweaking with the sockets to see if I can somehow get the port being connected to -- I can't :(

Zg - [8-Jun] - Added new_events.txt to the repository.
Zg - [9-Jun] - Applied the patch that was in RELEASE_0_3_1P1
Zg - [9-Jun] - Changed some things with quit/part messages; now it's like FreeNode: *** Nick has quit ("reason") vs. *** Nick has quit (Exit: reason)

Zg - [9-Jun] - Fixed bug #969405 (pinging if active)

Zg - [11-Jun] - Fixed bug #968650 (SOCKET.CLOSE not thrown when MaxClones is reached)

Zg - [13-Jun] - Fixed bug with new part messages: if the message is null, it no longer sends ""
Zg - [13-Jun] - Fixed bug with part messages: the correct casing of the room should now be returned in a /part
Zg - [13-Jun] - Fixed bug #972282 (Error 91 in m_part)
Zg - [14-Jun] - Fixed bug #969310 (M: line needs extension) -- should fix problems with WinServer2003

Zg - [15-Jun] - Fixed bug #972872 (QUIT doesn't subtract from unknown connections)
Zg - [15-Jun] - Fixed bug with the new oper level system (duplicate modes mess things up)
Zg - [15-Jun] - Fixed bug that allowed opers with an O: line that left out the ident (i.e. just a hostname) to get modes that they shouldn't get

Zg - [16-Jun] - Completed task #100127 (WALLOPS!)
Zg - [16-Jun] - Stuff I don't remember...
Zg - [16-Jun] - Corrected formatting mistake with /create (it would send the channel name as CREATE instead of parv(0))
Zg - [16-Jun] - Fixed bug #974079 (/create lets you make illegal channels)
Zg - [17-Jun] - Added command-line control.exe file. Works fine, except it will get stuck if you specify a bad port (default is 6667, can be specified with -p nnnn)
Zg - [18-Jun] - Added IRCXpro Migration Wizard -- far from completion, but the basics are in there. Now, you can migrate from IRCXpro to ignitionServer without losing everything (some things are lost, because I don't have the patience to read the IRCXpro manual to figure out what some stuff is)
Zg - [19-Jun] - More work on the migration wizard... now it reads the template and it does its business with the !insertmacros ^_^
Zg - [20-Jun] - Fixed bug where +O wasn't getting set
Zg - [20-Jun] - Fixed bug #975749 (disable switch for oper mode expansion)

Zg - [22-Jun] - Changed the "...is connecting from <addr>; IP address is <ip>" message to use raw 320 (RPL_WHOISSPECIAL) -- now it looks right in XChat :)
Zg - [22-Jun] - Fixed possible future bug (when I go to add_umodes and clean it up a bit)
Zg - [22-Jun] - Fixed bug #975143 (L: lines need to allow destination hostnames)
Zg - [22-Jun] - Fixed bug #977296 (really, really weird bugs with /server)
Zg - [22-Jun] - NJOIN now returns "Permission Denied" for people who aren't servers

Zg - [24-Jun] - Fixed bug #978619 (wrong /part raw)
Zg - [24-Jun] - Fixed bug #978588 (client exited/client quit need to be the same)
Zg - [24-Jun] - Completed task #100790 (X:AUTOVHOST)
Zg - [25-Jun] - ACCESS entries are now propragrated across the network (could use a little work)
Zg - [25-Jun] - Deleting *!*@* from an access list is now the same as clearing the access list
Zg - [25-Jun] - Fixed some erroneous CRLF's with access entry
Zg - [25-Jun] - Completed task #100820 (Knock/+u) -- probably need better knock reasons
Zg - [25-Jun] - HOPEFULLY fixed another bug with /raw close. In fact, if it's still moofing, it's with the GlobUsers() database (well, probably)
Zg - [26-Jun] - Completed task #100821 (Whisper)
Zg - [26-Jun] - Completed task #100869 (more oper modes)
Zg - [26-Jun] - Fixed bug #980102 (normal opers with +P/+p can't kick netadmins with +P/+p, and +P > +p)
Zg - [26-Jun] - Services can now set a channel's ACCOUNT property
Zg - [26-Jun] - SOCKET events have been "normalized" (although the local server address is a bit wrong)
Zg - [26-Jun] - Updated headers
Zg - [26-Jun] - Removed an unused file or two
Zg - [26-Jun] - Updated all other related files

Zg - [28-Jun] - Fixed bug that would send a PROP change to the server that originated the PROP change
Zg - [28-Jun] - Most server information is now propragrated across the network (dare I say all?)
Zg - [28-Jun] - Fixed bug #890133 (some channel info isn't sent to links) -- the above SHOULD be all of it.
Zg - [28-Jun] - New monitor! Works in all versions of Windows :). Depends on control.exe though.

Zg - [29-Jun] - Added resource files for automagically putting icons in ignitionServer and control.exe (since I was using ResHack before)
Zg - [29-Jun] - control.exe can now be started more than once (so the monitor doesn't entirely break when something's wrong)
Zg - [29-Jun] - Another monitor bug has been fixed - hopefully now it doesn't moof when a connection fails.
Zg - [30-Jun] - Fixed bug #982347 (ping timeouts aren't propragrated across the network)
Zg - [30-Jun] - The monitor now logs in properly.

### RELEASE - 0.3.2 - BETA 2 ###
#
Zg - [4-Jul] - Fixed bug #984801 ("No O-Lines for your host" lacks nickname)
Zg - [4-Jul] - Version number changes all over the place
Zg - [4-Jul] - Added a bunch of devel-docs to the repository
Zg - [8-Jul] - More work on the new mode code thingy (probably ready to implement)
Zg - [9-Jul] - I believe it's now time to add the new mode code to the project :). I'll probably keep the user mode code, since it's not quite as buggy as the channel mode code.
Zg - [9-Jul] - Might as well also put the channel ban list stuff too...
Zg - [10-Jul] - Added MAXTARGETS=5 to the 005 reply
Zg - [10-Jul] - Removed STD=i-d because I have no idea what it means
Zg - [10-Jul] - Added some more stuff to the 005 reply (nicklen, max channels per user, etc.)
Zg - [10-Jul] - Fixed bug #983820 (mode bug)
Zg - [10-Jul] - Fixed bug with the output of the "you have joined too many channels" error

Zg - [13-Jul] - Fixed bug #989095 (you can set mode +l 0)
Zg - [13-Jul] - Fixed bug #988757 (new mode code has broken ban support)

Zg - [15-Jul] - Fixed bug #988705 (+hps mode problem)
Zg - [15-Jul] - Fixed bug #989920 (+h cannot be set by links)
Zg - [15-Jul] - Worked on some prop cleanup
Zg - [16-Jul] - Added user properties GUID, Identity, Nick, and OID.
Zg - [16-Jul] - For some reason, the GUIDs generated are nothing like normal Windows GUIDs. Perhaps a good thing.
Zg - [16-Jul] - For the record, GUIDs change every time a connection is (re)opened. This means it's useless to use a GUID to tell one user from another.
Zg - [16-Jul] - Worked on some LIST code. As a result, channel names can no longer contain * or ?.
Zg - [16-Jul] - Fixed bug that prevented /join 0 from working. You can now part all with /join 0 :)
Zg - [16-Jul] - /list with wildcards now works. Apparently, VB has a more advanced Like thing than I thought :)
Zg - [17-Jul] - Fixed bug #888693 (wildcard listing is broken) [see above]
Zg - [19-Jul] - Changed Winsock errors returned as "Unknown" to the error message defined by the Platform SDK
Zg - [20-Jul] - Found some code on PSCode that can properly get the LocalPort! Now, I can "normalize" the events properly :).
Zg - [20-Jul] - For some stupid reason, ignitionServer used Winsock 1.1. Now, we're using Winsock 2.0 or higher. It seems a bit smoother, now.
Zg - [20-Jul] - Fixed bug #994283 (you can send blank messages)
Zg - [20-Jul] - Wee bit of code cleanup...
Zg - [20-Jul] - Changed some Integers to Longs, should speed some things up 1/1000th of a millisecond... :)
Zg - [20-Jul] - Changed places where for some reason the PureIRCd team felt the urge to use Val as an array to use something else. Val is a function built into VB already. Fixing this cuts compile time by at least 6 seconds.
Zg - [21-Jul] - Most USER events are now complete. USER.JOIN and USER.PART need to be remapped to MEMBER.
Zg - [21-Jul] - Converted USER.PART and USER.JOIN to MEMBER.PART and MEMBER.JOIN
Zg - [21-Jul] - MEMBER.MODE complete
Zg - [21-Jul] - MEMBER.KICK complete
Zg - [21-Jul] - TODO: Replace all instances of ServerLocalAddr with clsClient.LocalHostname (and make a function that gets the local hostname, similar to clsClient.LocalPort)
Zg - [21-Jul] - Did some USER.LOGOFF stuff... USER.DISCONNECT... and probably a bunch of others
Zg - [21-Jul] - Fixed some more event bugs (mostly duplicate event sends and stuff)
Zg - [21-Jul] - Removed a SaveSetting that is no longer needed (old workaround for the old ignitionServer Monitor)
Zg - [21-Jul] - CHANNEL.MODE, CHANNEL.TOPIC, CHANNEL.CREATE, yada yada yada
Zg - [21-Jul] - More channel events :)
Zg - [21-Jul] - Fixed bug #965947 (some events need consistency)
Zg - [25-Jul] - Preparing for release...
Zg - [25-Jul] - Fixed bug where you could create a channel with ? or * in the name
#
### RELEASE - 0.3.3 - BETA 3 ###
#
Zg - [25-Jul] - Version rollup
Zg - [25-Jul] - Removed Half-Op entirely. We'll never use it, and it doesn't work anyways. Added plus: Saved a few KB of memory
Zg - [25-Jul] - Began adding support for IRCX auditorium.
Zg - [26-Jul] - Auditorium is now working, to an extent. Things to do: do PRIVMSG/NOTICE properly, keep double mode sends from occuring
Zg - [27-Jul] - More Auditorium Stuff!
Zg - [27-Jul] - Sadly, auditorium is currently broken.
Zg - [27-Jul] - Auditorium appears to be completely working! Probably need to mess with /who and /whois so users don't appear (shouldn't this go with the +hps bug?)
Zg - [1-Aug] - Worked on the new XML configuration format
Zg - [1-Aug] - Clone is now working, to an extent (still tweaking for full effect)
Zg - [1-Aug] - Modified 004 reply to contain the version of ignitionServer -- for stats programs and such
Zg - [1-Aug] - VERSION reply now ends in .0
Zg - [2-Aug] - More work on clone/cloneable. When a clone is created, the properties are propragrated (need to do access lists).

Zg - [2-Aug] - Fixed bug #1001722 (IRC Operators can change properties as if they were owners)
Zg - [3-Aug] - Completed task #99517 (IRCX cloning - +d/+e)
Zg - [3-Aug] - Added docs/security to the repository; contains security issues, fixes, etc. More of an informational thing than anything.
Zg - [5-Aug] - It's August, stupid!
Zg - [7-Aug] - Hidden, private, and secret now are handled properly with /who.
Zg - [7-Aug] - /names does +hps properly now
Zg - [7-Aug] - Work on the format of the XML configuration file -- sadly, the new XML configuration system won't be making it to the next release :( let's try 0.3.5 :P
Zg - [7-Aug] - Changed the SendQ to be a *bit* more realistic, and to actually have an effect on operations. Basically, 20*512 for clients, 30*512 for opers and 60*512 for opers. That allows for a whole 20 or 30 lines to be in a user's queue at any given time. That's plenty enough.
Zg - [7-Aug] - More work on the format of the XML configuration file
Zg - [7-Aug] - Parse error? Huh?
Zg - [8-Aug] - /whois now honors +phs :)
Zg - [8-Aug] - /prop honors +phs
Zg - [8-Aug] - Fixed bug #1001723 (cannot check properties from outside of channel)

AW - [8-Aug] - Removed more halfop code
Zg - [8-Aug] - Worked on XML Configuration File some more
Zg - [8-Aug] - Fixed a small bug; X:CREATEMODE now behaves properly
Zg - [8-Aug] - When the user sends a /quit message in an auditorium, it's handled properly
Zg - [8-Aug] - Error messages and socket closes are now handled properly in auditoriums
Zg - [8-Aug] - Ping Timeout QUITs are now handled properly in auditoriums
Zg - [8-Aug] - Fixed bug #1005367 (auditorium users see erroneous quits)
Zg - [8-Aug] - More release notes stuff
Zg - [9-Aug] - It got really annoying trying to use the IRCX Draft for reference, so I'm in the process of translating it to DocBook format. That will make it much simpler to use for reference.
Zg - [9-Aug] - Some more work on translating the IRCX Draft into DocBook format
Zg - [9-Aug] - Created a batch file to generate XHTML files with xsltproc
Zg - [9-Aug] - More commands into DocBook, added some editor's notes
Zg - [9-Aug] - Few more commands added into the DocBook file
Zg - [9-Aug] - Added more commands to the IRCX Draft DocBook

Zg - [12-Aug] - Updated the MigWiz Config Template
Zg - [12-Aug] - Updated Release Notes too
Zg - [13-Aug] - ignitionServer's currently passing QA tests, time to take -cvs from the name
#
### RELEASE - 0.3.4 - BETA 4 ###
#
Zg - [14-Aug] - Finished IRCX draft DocBook! Whee!
Zg - [14-Aug] - Fixed bug #1007675 (CREATE is entirely wrong)

Zg - [15-Aug] - Devel-doc for new command NPROP

Zg - [12-Sep] - Fixed bug #1026823 (need X:MONITORIP for Server 2003 users)
Zg - [13-Sep] - Added a warning to the m_nick code used to verify the password. It now yells at you if you've made a really stupid mistake in ircx.conf.

Zg - [25-Sep] - Completed feature request #1016956 (X:STATICCHAN)
Zg - [1-Oct] - Added some compile-time stuff that allows you to change the symbol used to denote user levels. Mainly for advanced users, or users who might want to make owners and hosts both show as @. Someone needs to look over the code and make sure I didn't miss any spots.
Zg - [9-Oct] - Fixed bug #1043391 (Cannot kick hosts)
Zg - [9-Oct] - Oops, update release notes.
Zg - [9-Oct] - Also, remove those awful B: line defaults from ircx.conf.
Zg - [9-Oct] - Removed -cvs token for release
Zg - [9-Oct] - Installer tweak
Zg - [9-Oct] - Also a good idea to set X:DIE to 1 :)
Zg - [9-Oct] - And a much better idea to remove the default static channels

Zg - [1-Dec] - Logging isn't working. It's giving me a headache. Also, it keeps throwing fatal exceptions for random reasons.
Zg - [1-Dec] - You know, I really ought to have read my code better. The logging statements must go outside of the SendToChan expecting true crap, or it won't work. Man I feel dumb.
Zg - [2-Dec] - Oops, add the modes to the 005 reply + add constants
Zg - [2-Dec] - Set +z on channels when they're being watched

Zg - [30-Dec] - Better handling of IRC logons
Zg - [30-Dec] - Fix a compile error
Zg - [31-Dec] - Add PASS checking to SERVER, don't want a major vulnerability (again, needs testing)
Zg - [15-Jan] - Fixed bug #1058833 (PASS automatically attempts to authenticate you as a server if there is no logon password, even if you lack all the credentials, preventing users from sending the PASS command at all if there is no logon password)

Zg - [6-Apr] - Fixed bug in the process that would make a for loop start at 1 and go to 0 in a collection with no items; basically, bounds-checking on the access entry stuff
Zg - [8-Apr] - Need a more consistant error message thing. Probably am going to rip off Cisco sort of. %BUG: Message, %DEBUG: Message, and so on. There's stuff like that on Cisco routers.
Zg - [10-Apr] - Add script to make source archives (for quick branch releases or what have you)
Zg - [13-Apr] - ACCESS ADD/DELETE for clients now uses exact matching, still broken though (DELETE isn't working)

Zg - [26-May] - Fixed bug that let users ban protected operators. Now, you can ban them, but they can come back.

Zg - [2-Jun] - Make the installer way more intelligent, give more debugging information in CVS builds.
Zg - [2-Jun] - If ignitionServer is installed using this version of the installer or newer, it'll warn you that it's overwriting config files. Useless for users of 0.3.6 or earlier, but useful from now on.
Zg - [5-Jun] - Move the MMC snap-in to ./dormant, since it is. I'd delete it, but maybe some programmer somewhere will want to play with it.. -_-
Zg - [11-Jun] - Fixed a small bug within some #If and #End If's. It made Super Debug(TM) not work.
Zg - [14-Jun] - Add the SERVICE bitmask doc to the repository (for future SERVICE command)
Zg - [14-Jun] - Begin splitting up the monolithic modules into smaller, easier to edit ones. Started with ACCESS.
Zg - [28-Jun] - Split m_access finally....

Zg - [8-Jul] - Fixed bug #1183453 (run "Unknown access entry" though the text parser)
Zg - [19-Jul] - Modify /info, give it a codename. "Black Dog" is the codename for 0.3.7. ..gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove.. :D
